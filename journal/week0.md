**Ruby**

Ruby is a high-level, interpreted programming language. It's known for its simplicity and productivity, with an elegant syntax that's natural to read and easy to write. Created by Yukihiro Matsumoto in the mid-1990s, Ruby has become popular for its use in web development, among other applications.

**Ruby on Rails (or simply Rails)**

Ruby on Rails, often just called **Rails**, is a server-side web application framework written in Ruby. It's a model-view-controller (MVC) framework that provides default structures for a database, a web service, and web pages. Rails emphasizes the use of well-known software engineering patterns and paradigms, such as convention over configuration (CoC), don't repeat yourself (DRY), and the active record pattern.
Rails is particularly noted for its ease of use and speed of development. It allows developers to get a working web application up and running with minimal configuration and coding, making it a popular choice for web application development.
Rails is not a programming language itself; it's a framework that uses Ruby as its underlying language. It extends Ruby's capabilities, enabling developers to build complex web applications more efficiently.

#### **Gems**

Gems in the context of Ruby are essentially libraries or packages that extend the functionality of Ruby applications. Each gem contains a packaged Ruby application or library.
RubyGems, the package manager for Ruby, provides a standard format for distributing Ruby programs and libraries and a tool for managing the installation of gems.
Rails itself is distributed as a gem. When you install Rails using gem install rails, you're actually downloading and installing the Rails gem and its dependencies.
Developers can use gems to add new features to their Ruby applications without having to write these features from scratch. There's a gem for almost everything â€“ from handling user authentication to managing file uploads, processing payments, and much more.

**Amalgamation in the Ruby Ecosystem**

The Ruby ecosystem, particularly for web development, often involves using Rails as the web framework and a variety of gems to add specific functionalities. This combination enables developers to build powerful, feature-rich web applications with relatively little boilerplate code.
The cohesive integration of Ruby, Rails, and gems makes development smoother and more efficient, adhering to Rails' philosophy of making developers happy and productive.

**In summary** 

While Ruby is the programming language, Rails is a web framework built using Ruby, and gems are modular libraries that can be used in Ruby (and Rails) applications to extend their capabilities. This integration forms a robust platform for web development.
