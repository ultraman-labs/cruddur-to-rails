    ** Wow! In the sign-in page of Cruddur, I was receiving an error of "User pool us-west-1_gOH8uljSz does not exist." <br>
       This threw me good! I initially thought to look in the docker-compose.yml file for code line that referenced <br>
       the "REACT_APP_AWS_USER_POOLS_ID" environment variable-- which contained the prior "User pool ID" that AWS <br>
       Cognito generated. After updating this variable, I went back and restarted the docker-compose.ym file. But <br>
       the sign-in error persisted. Hmmm...what the strange tacos was going on!? Okay, somehow I made the cerbral <br>
       leap of thinking that perhaps the REACT_APP_CLIENT_ID env var had change as well--- well it did! So I grabbed <br>
       (copied) the new Client ID that Cognito generated, and updated the pertinent variable in docker-compose.yml <br>
       Restarted the docker file and voila! After going back to the Cruddur sign-in page I was able to log in! </p>
